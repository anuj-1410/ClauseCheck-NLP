# Project Title

**ClauseCheck – Bilingual Legal Contract Risk & Compliance Analyzer**

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements of ClauseCheck, a bilingual AI-powered legal contract analysis system.

The system analyzes legal documents in Hindi and English, detects risks and compliance issues, and generates an explainable report. Documents are processed temporarily and deleted after analysis. Only final structured results are stored in Supabase PostgreSQL.

---

## 1.2 Scope

ClauseCheck will:

* Accept typed and scanned legal documents
* Support English and Hindi
* Use OCR for printed scanned documents
* Perform clause-level NLP analysis
* Detect obligations and risks
* Generate compliance scores
* Store only final structured results
* Delete original documents after processing

The system will NOT:

* Verify stamps or signatures
* Process handwritten documents
* Provide legal advice
* Store raw documents permanently

---

## 3.7 Obligation Detection

System shall detect:

* Modal verbs (shall, must, may)

* Action to be performed
* Conditions and deadlines

---

## 3.8 Risk Detection

System shall detect risky clauses such as:

* Unlimited liability
* One-sided termination
* Missing notice period
* Auto-renewal clauses
* Vague penalties

Each clause will be labeled:

* High risk
* Medium risk
* Low risk

---

## 3.9 Compliance Checking

System shall:

* Check presence of essential clauses
* Detect missing important clauses
* Map clauses to predefined legal rule set
* Generate compliance score (0–100)

---

## 3.10 Explanation Generation

System shall:

* Provide simple-language explanation
* Highlight risky clause text
* Explain why clause is flagged

---

## 3.11 Result Storage

System shall store in Supabase:

* Document name
* Language
* Risk score
* Compliance score
* Clause analysis (JSONB)
* Summary
* Timestamp

System shall NOT store:

* Raw document
* Extracted full text

---

## 3.12 Document Deletion

After analysis:

* Temporary file shall be deleted
* Memory buffer cleared
* No raw data retained

---

# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

🎯 What Your SRS Currently Lacks
1. Core Missing Features
Your SRS has the foundation but is missing these essential capabilities:
❌ No Plain English Explanation Generator

Your SRS mentions "simple-language explanation" but doesn't detail it as a core feature
Should add: Automatic translation of legal jargon → everyday language
Example: "Notwithstanding the foregoing..." → "Even if the contract says otherwise..."
This is THE killer feature for non-lawyers

❌ No Contract Comparison Feature

Missing: Upload multiple versions and see what changed
Missing: Compare your contract vs industry standard
Missing: "Which party gained power in v2?"
This is critical for negotiations

❌ No Responsibility & Blame Analyzer

Your SRS doesn't detect who is actually responsible
Missing: Passive voice detection ("shall be ensured" - by whom??)
Missing: Ambiguous obligation flagging
This is where contracts hide traps

❌ No Timeline & Deadline Visualization

You mention "Duration" extraction but no timeline feature
Should add: Interactive timeline of all obligations
Visual calendar showing: payment dates, renewal dates, notice periods
Auto-generate reminders

❌ No Compliance Readiness Dashboard

You have "compliance score" but no visual dashboard
Should add:

Risk severity meter (0-100)
Compliance radar chart across categories
Missing clause counter
Color-coded risk heatmap



❌ No "What-If" Scenario Simulator

Missing: "What if I change termination notice from 30 to 15 days?"
Missing: Risk prediction for clause modifications
This would be a standout feature

❌ No Jurisdiction-Aware Analysis

Your SRS mentions "legal rule set" but doesn't specify jurisdiction handling
Should add: User selects location → system applies relevant laws
Maharashtra labor laws ≠ Karnataka labor laws ≠ US laws

❌ No Interactive Q&A System

Missing: "Ask anything about your contract"
Missing: RAG-based chatbot that answers specific questions
Example: "What happens if I quit before 6 months?"

2. Inadequate Feature Depth
Your existing features need more detail:
🔧 Risk Detection is Too Vague
Current SRS says:

"Unlimited liability, one-sided termination, missing notice period..."

Should specify:

Detection methodology: Rule-based patterns + semantic similarity + ML classifier
Explanation depth: Not just "this is risky" but "this is risky BECAUSE..."
Comparison: "89% of similar contracts have a termination notice period"
Visual highlighting: Exact risky text highlighted in red in the document viewer

🔧 Compliance Checking Lacks Specificity
Current SRS says:

"Check presence of essential clauses"

Should specify:

Which clauses are essential? (Define a compliance checklist per contract type)
Legal backing: Reference specific law sections (e.g., "Section 27 of Indian Contract Act")
Severity levels: Critical missing vs optional missing
Suggested clause templates: "Add this amendment clause: [template]"

🔧 Explanation Generation is Underspecified
Current SRS says:

"Provide simple-language explanation"

Should specify:

Clause-by-clause breakdown: Each clause gets a plain English card
Risk reasoning: "This clause is flagged because X, which violates Y law"
Action recommendations: "To fix this, you should..."
Comparison context: "This is unusual because most contracts..."

3. Missing User Experience Features
❌ No Document Annotation

Users can't highlight or comment on specific clauses
No ability to mark clauses as "reviewed" or "needs attention"
No collaborative features (share with lawyer/partner for their input)

❌ No Report Generation Options

Only stores "structured results" in DB
Should add: Export detailed PDF report with:

Executive summary
Risk breakdown
Recommended actions
Comparison charts
Legal references



❌ No Negotiation Assistant

Missing: "How to negotiate this clause" guidance
Missing: Email templates for requesting changes
Missing: Alternative clause suggestions

❌ No Learning/Education Mode

Missing: "Why is this clause important?"
Missing: Educational tooltips explaining legal concepts
Missing: "Glossary of legal terms found in your contract"

4. Technical Gaps
❌ No Confidence Scores

Your system should output confidence levels
"85% confident this is an unlimited liability clause"
Low confidence → flag for human review

❌ No Explainability Architecture

SRS mentions "explainable NLP" but doesn't describe HOW
Should add: Attention visualization, rule traceability, citation of training data

❌ No Feedback Loop

Missing: Users can correct wrong classifications
Missing: System learns from corrections
Missing: "Was this analysis helpful?" rating

❌ No Multi-Language Support in Practice

You say "Hindi and English" but don't specify:

Mixed-language contracts (Hinglish)
Translation of explanations to Hindi
Code-switching handling

🔥 Critical Additions to Make Your SRS "Perfect"
Add Section 3.5: Domain-Specific Contract Types
Your SRS should specify analysis customization for:

Employment Contracts

Focus: Non-compete, notice period, benefits
Laws: Labor codes, minimum wage laws


Service Agreements

Focus: Deliverables, payment terms, IP ownership
Laws: Contract Act, IT Act


NDAs

Focus: Scope of confidentiality, duration, exceptions
Laws: Information privacy laws


Rental Agreements

Focus: Deposit terms, maintenance, termination
Laws: Rent control acts, tenant rights


Freelance/Consulting Contracts

Focus: Scope, payment, ownership
Laws: GST, TDS, contractor rights



Add Section 3.6: Risk Severity Classification
Define 3-tier system:
🔴 Critical Risks (Score 80-100)

Unlimited liability
IP ownership transfer
Non-compete > 2 years
One-sided termination
No dispute resolution

🟡 Medium Risks (Score 40-79)

Vague payment terms
Long notice periods
Auto-renewal without notification
Ambiguous deliverables
Missing confidentiality scope

🟢 Low Risks (Score 0-39)

Standard boilerplate clauses
Common industry terms
Balanced obligations

Add Section 7.2: Enhanced Database Schema
Your current schema is too simple. Add tables for:
sql-- Track clause-level analysis
clauses (
  id,
  analysis_id,
  clause_number,
  text,
  category,
  risk_level,
  confidence_score,
  explanation
)

-- Track detected entities
entities (
  id,
  analysis_id,
  entity_type, -- party, date, amount, duration
  entity_value,
  clause_id
)

-- Track obligations
obligations (
  id,
  analysis_id,
  responsible_party,
  action_required,
  deadline,
  condition,
  clause_id
)

-- Track user feedback
feedback (
  id,
  analysis_id,
  clause_id,
  user_correction,
  rating,
  timestamp
)

-- Track comparison analysis
comparisons (
  id,
  analysis_id_1,
  analysis_id_2,
  differences_json,
  timestamp
)
Add Section 8: Limitations (Expand)
Be more specific about what it CAN'T do:
❌ Cannot determine legal validity (courts decide)
❌ Cannot replace professional legal advice
❌ Cannot handle heavily redacted documents
❌ Cannot verify authenticity of signatures/stamps
❌ Cannot access real-time case law databases
❌ Cannot handle handwritten contracts
❌ Accuracy depends on contract clarity
❌ May miss context-specific risks
❌ Hindi NLP has lower accuracy than English
❌ Cannot predict human behavior in disputes
Add Section 11: Use Cases
Show real-world scenarios:
Use Case 1: Job Offer Evaluation

Upload: Employment contract from company
Goal: Understand obligations before signing
Output: Plain English summary, risk assessment, negotiation points

Use Case 2: Freelancer-Client Agreement

Upload: Service agreement draft
Goal: Ensure IP ownership is protected
Output: IP clause analysis, missing clause alerts, suggested additions

Use Case 3: Apartment Rental

Upload: Rental agreement
Goal: Check for unfair deposit terms
Output: Compliance check against rent control laws, risk flags

Use Case 4: Contract Negotiation
